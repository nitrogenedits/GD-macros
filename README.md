# GD-macros
use them with xdBot if you have Geode, or if you think it's not legit, beat the level on your own. :)
# HOW DO I USE THEM?
pause the level it's designed for, open xdBot (small resume button in the corner), tap "load" below the 2 checkboxes and open the GDR file.
# WHAT VERSION OF GEOMETRY DASH DO I NEED?
2.207
# WHAT FPS BYPASS DO I NEED?
the macros were made at 5000 FPS (**NOT** physics bypass). you may set it either through mega hack / eclipse, or the GD settings menu.



enjoy!
